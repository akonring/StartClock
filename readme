The best approach dealing the chronometer issue::

Do not instatiate object in the activity, but keep the chronometer in application
This implies using textstrings in activity as chronometer, but how to listen?
Maybe bind the chronometer-view to the global chronometer.. but how?

Having time offset when resetting the view and creating the view will deal with it
which methods gets called when?
